## Multiplayer UI
Scripts for multiplayer interface situations, such as picking [abilities](https://github.com/bcverdict/Dungeon448/blob/master/scripts/scr_multi_ability_select/scr_multi_ability_select.gml)
and [selecting characters](https://github.com/bcverdict/Dungeon448/blob/master/scripts/scr_multi_char_select/scr_multi_char_select.gml), had to be built.
## Xbox Remote Support
Local multiplayer on a keyboard was decided to be a poor design choice. So Xbox remote support was not only built to support single player but also multiplayer.
## Leveling and Experience System
Earning experience points and gaining levels was implemented by giving points to players for killing monsters. After a certain amount of points, as indicated by the exp bar,
you gain a level and a credit that can be spent on abilities.
## Abilities
I created all interfaces dealing with abilities and the code behind the abilities. These abilities gave the players give players more freedom in play style.

## UI for Ability Purchases
New UI had to be implemented for both [single player](https://github.com/bcverdict/Dungeon448/blob/master/scripts/scr_ability_select/scr_ability_select.gml) and 
[multiplayer](https://github.com/bcverdict/Dungeon448/blob/master/scripts/scr_multi_ability_select/scr_multi_ability_select.gml) abilities.

## Animations
All animations seen in the UI and when using abilities in game where created by me in GIMP.
